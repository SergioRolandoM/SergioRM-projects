# Hi, welcome to my Github!

I'm Sergio Rolando Martinez, a web development student, and I'd like to showcase my projects and what I'm currently working on.

## My projects

### HOOKDB
##### Introduction
It is a web project focused on video game information and voting, developed by two people. The project took approximately four months to complete.

My teammate was in charge of the backend. He used:
- Spring: to build the REST API.
- Docker: to set up the containers.
- Hibernate: to connect Spring with MySQL.

In my case, I was responsible for the frontend. I used:
- Figma: to create the design of our website.
- React: used to build the website and create a SPA. This was my first project with React and also the most ambitious I had developed up to that point.
- CSS: to create the styles for the website.
- React Router: a library for efficient page-to-page navigation.
- Toastify: a library for displaying popup notifications.

### [FilmView](https://dsertor.github.io/FilmView/index.html) 
I had to develop a website on a theme defined by me, taking into account the color palette, making it responsive, and having the homepage divided into four sections. I used some Javascript, however, I had limited time to complete this project, and in the future, I would like to add more interactivity to it.

### [Spotify clone](https://github.com/Dsertor/Spotify-clone) (WIP)
This is a project built with React and TypeScript that replicates Spotify’s web interface using endpoints from its API

### [Xiaomi SO]() (WIP)
In this project, I’m trying to clone the development of a Redmi 13 Pro, from powering it on to building some apps.
